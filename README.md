## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run migrations to create the database schema:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Start the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The project should now be running locally at `http://localhost:8000/`.


## Project Overview
#### The project is divided into four sections, each with a distinct set of tasks and points:
### Section 1: Project Setup, Advanced Feed Analysis, and Mapping 

- Create a fresh Django project and dedicate an app to your endeavor.

- Configure the app to utilize PostgreSQL as your database.

- Inaugurate a Git repository and commit your initial project files.

- Implement custom JWT authentication based on storing access tokens in Redis.

- Analyze and select ten RSS feeds from various sources, including APIs and custom XML feeds.

- Explore feed metadata, custom tags, and namespaces.

- Implement advanced parsing techniques, including XML namespaces, and extract rich content.

- Map the data structure of each RSS feed source to the appropriate database model fields, considering dynamic content.

- Create advanced models for RSS feeds, feed items, user subscriptions, and user interactions.

- Implement advanced data validation and constraints.

- Design a flexible schema that can accommodate diverse feed structures.

- Create a comprehensive project setup guide.

- Document your advanced analysis and data mapping approaches.

- Discuss strategies for handling evolving feed structures.

### Section 2: Advanced RSS Feed Scraping, Content Processing, and Dockerization

- Implement a distributed feed scraping system with Celery, allowing for parallel processing of multiple feeds.

- Handle edge cases, such as rate limiting, feed updates, and failed scrapes.

- Create a retry mechanism for failed scrapes.

- Extract and analyze content from feed items, including text, images, and embedded media.

- Implement custom algorithms for categorizing and summarizing feed content.

- Create custom algorithms for sentiment analysis and content recommendations.

- Allow users to interact with enriched content, such as liking, commenting, and saving.

- Dockerize your Django application for development.

- Create a Dockerfile that sets up the necessary environment for your Django project, including Python dependencies and database connections.

- Use Docker Compose to define a development environment with services like PostgreSQL for the database and Celery for distributed task processing.

- Configure Docker Compose to link your Django application with these services.
### Section 3: Periodic Updates, User Dashboards, and Analytics 

- Implement periodic tasks using a task scheduler (e.g., Celery Beat) to update RSS feeds at defined intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).

- Configure the task scheduler to trigger feed updates automatically.

- Handle edge cases, such as rate limiting and concurrent feed updates, to ensure data integrity.

- Log update events and errors for monitoring.

- Develop personalized user dashboards for managing subscriptions, notifications, and saved items.

- Implement analytics to track user behavior, popular feeds, and trending content.

- Create visualizations for user insights.

- Enhance the notification system with push notifications for mobile devices. (optional)

- Implement intelligent notification scheduling based on user activity patterns.

- Enable users to set up custom notification triggers and actions.

### Section 4: Advanced Logging with Structlog and Elasticsearch, Final Enhancements

- Incorporate Structlog for structured logging within your Django application.

- Configure Structlog to format logs in a structured JSON format.

- Implement logging for critical application events, such as feed scraping errors, user interactions, and system health checks.

- Integrate Elasticsearch as a log storage backend for efficient log management.

- Set up Elasticsearch indices and templates for log storage.

- Create a searchable log repository using Elasticsearch to monitor and debug application events.

- Implement log rotation and retention policies for managing log data.

- Fine-tune the application for optimal performance, handling high volumes of data efficiently.

- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce response times.

- Enhance the user interface and user experience with additional features and improvements based on user feedback.

- Optimize database queries for improved performance.

- Implement advanced security measures such as rate limiting and request validation.
